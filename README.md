### Hi there, I'm Lasse Langhorn :wave:

I am a full stack software developer and AWS solutions architect.

I currently live in Aalborg, Denmark.

I have a passion for creating software in Java, Python, JavaScript and TypeScript and work with cloud computing, especially [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lasselanghorn/) and that is pretty much it. :grin:

Iâ€™m currently learning generative ai and machine learning.

I really like:
- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - The best IDE for just about any coding task.
- [github.com](https://github.com/) - A great place to store and share code.
- [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) - The best cloud provider IMO.
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) - Great Python web framework.
- [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/) - A powerful JavaScript framework.
- Linux - Just a great operating system.
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) - A great Java platform.

In the future I would like to have many public repositories.
